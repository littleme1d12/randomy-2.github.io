### Hi, I am **Jiahe Yan**!
I recently graduated from the **University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)** with a B.S. in Computer Science, where I was honored to receive a **$7,500 award** from the UCLA Internet Research Initiative for my work on distributed stochastic gradient descent (SGD) under the mentorship of [**Prof. Leonard Kleinrock**](https://www.lk.cs.ucla.edu/index.html) and [**Prof. Pratik Chaudhari**](https://pratikac.github.io/). I also collaborated with [**Prof. Remy Wang**](https://remy.wang/), exploring how to optimize data systems using techniques from programming languages and databases.

I am interested in **building robust, high-performance data computing systems** that can automatically adapt to dynamic workloads across domains like relational queries, graph analytics, and high-dimensional tensor computations. I want to explore building **unified abstractions** that bridge ideas from programming languages, databases, and tensor algebra. Ultimately, I aim to design **scalable system architectures** that leverage these optimizations to safely and efficiently handle evolving data challenges—treating every workload as if the system had been purpose-built for it.

I am currently a **Software Development Engineer** at **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**, designing large-scale, fault-tolerant systems that power AWS’s global account management services. My daily work involves building auto-scalable microservices, optimizing event-driven workflows, and ensuring our distributed pipelines can handle massive volumes of data without compromising on performance or reliability.

In the broader open source community, I’ve contributed to open-source projects [**Xorbits**](https://github.com/xorbitsai) and [**Mars**](https://github.com/mars-project), both of which aim to provide frameworks for large-scale distributed data processing. At **Xorbits**, I developed a JIT-based runtime computation graph node fusion optimizer, integrated NCCL-based GPU communication primitives, and implemented distributed synchronous SGD. At **Mars**, I built out REST APIs to retrieve DAG task graphs over a distributed actor framework, designed graph visualizations using React and D3.js, and integrated over a dozen SciPy functions for large-scale tensor computations.
